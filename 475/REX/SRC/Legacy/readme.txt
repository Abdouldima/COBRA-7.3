1. stage0_file_legacy is old stage0 payload that was used pre 4.65 COBRA CFW.

This is easily portable for beginners, I'd recommend using this if you have hard time porting habib's stage0_base payload insde lv2kernel.

2. ps2netemu_legacy is old buggy ps2netemu payload, this has the same patches that were used in 4.46 cobra payload,

unfortunately due to changes in ps2netemu since 4.50, original payload causing sync issues with wireless controllers when playing ps2 games on non backward compatible PS3s

You can however play around with this if you're interested in debugging this emu.
